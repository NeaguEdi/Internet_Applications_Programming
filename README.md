# Project - Internet Applications Programming
This project is a dynamic sports article website developed as a final project for a course. The main goal was to create a functional and interactive web platform for publishing and viewing articles related to various sports.  The website was built using a combination of foundational web technologies:      HTML was used to structure the content, including article layouts, navigation menus, and header.      CSS was used for styling, ensuring a clean and modern design with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This included custom fonts, color schemes, and visual effects to improve user experience.      JavaScript was integrated to add interactive elements, such as dynamic content loading, form validation, and user interface animations.      PHP was utilized for backend development, handling server-side logic such as managing article data, user authentication, and interactions with a database. This allowed for a fully functional content management system.
